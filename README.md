Atlique Hardware is a company which supplies different hardware components to different clients. They have different branches in different cities in India. Mr. Bavin Patel is a Sales Director for the Headquarters of Atlique Hardware. His company's sales start declining and he wants to know the answer for why the sales are declining. So he asked his regional managers in different branches regarding this problem. They gave lots of excel files to him and it could not provide any valuable insights.

In order to overcome this problem, we use **SQL and Tableau** to get valuable insights from the data and to take effective decisions by creating realtime and interactive **Revenue and Profit Analysis Dashboards**.

## What is MySQL Database?
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups. <br>
## What is Tableau?
Tableau is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry. It helps in simplifying raw data in a very easily understandable format. Tableau helps create the data that can be understood by professionals at any level in an organization. It also allows non-technical users to create customized dashboards. Data analysis is very fast with Tableau tool and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets.
#### The best features of Tableau are
* Data Blending
* Realtime Analysis
* Collaboration of Data
## Structure of the Project

## Process and Implementation of the Project
#### 1. Data Collection and Storage
  Data could be collected from the Atlique Hardware Database and stored into MySQL database for getting analysis and insights.
#### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
  Since the data we collected is a raw data i.e it cannot be used for analysis directly because it contains 
  * Null values
  * Duplicate values
  * Inappropriate values
  * Contains some outliers
  
  So we use MySQL and Tableau Data Source interface to clean, filter and      pre-process data for analysis and visualization.
#### 3. Analyzing and Creating Visualization using Tableau
After pre-processing the raw data into usable data, the next is to start analyzing and create visualization dashboard using Tableau. In this project, we create two dashboards
* Atlique Hardware Sales Revenue Analysis Dashboard.
* Atlique Hardware Sales Profit Analysis Dashboard.

Both of the dashboards are realtime and interactive dashboards.
#### 4. Getting insights and make effective decisions using Tableau
After created the dashboards, we can get valuable insights from the data that we couldnâ€™t get from the excel sheets. We can make effective business decisions regarding sales declining using the dashboards.
